/**
 * Crash reporting for the Electron main process — the updater, the app://
 * protocol handler, and window management. Failures there are the ones the
 * renderer can never tell us about, because they stop the window existing.
 *
 * The opt-in lives in renderer localStorage, which this process cannot read, so
 * the preference is mirrored to disk (see `electron/preload.ts` →
 * `telemetry:set-enabled`). That mirror is what makes early-startup gating
 * possible at all: by the time the renderer could tell us, the crash we most
 * want is already over.
 *
 * Three defaults are switched off deliberately:
 *
 * - **SentryMinidump** — native minidumps embed process memory. A renderer crash
 *   dump would carry decoded audio and transcript text, which is exactly what
 *   the app promises never to upload. This is the one integration that could
 *   turn a crash report into a media leak, so it stays off even though it costs
 *   us native crash visibility.
 * - **LocalVariables** — attaches local variable values to frames. In this
 *   process those are mostly filesystem paths, and it's a wide surface to have
 *   to keep scrubbing.
 * - **attachScreenshot** — left at its default of `false`. A screenshot of this
 *   app is a screenshot of someone's transcript.
